= Weekly Show

This gem will show the current week for your table.

To install, simply add to your Gemfile

[NOTE]
 gem 'weekly_show'

[NOTE]
 @bundle install@.

Anywhere in Rails view (yes, it currently has a Rails dependency), call
 ws = WeeklyShow.new
 ws.show_last_three_weeks

It will now show a table of the last three weeks, with the last 14 days,
including today, marked with a classname "two-weeks" and anything outside of
that period, "not-two-weeks".  For today, the classname will be "today".
