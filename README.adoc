- Weekly Show

This gem will show the current week for your table.

To install, simply add to your Gemfile

[Gemfile]
 gem 'weekly_show'

[Terminal]
 bundle install.

In Rails (it depends on Rails)
[Controller]
 @ws = WeeklyShow.new

[View]
 <%= @ws.show_last_three_weeks %>

It will now show a table of the last three weeks, with the last 14 days,
including today, marked with a classname "two-weeks" and anything outside of
that period, "not-two-weeks".  For today, the classname will be "today".
